Problem #1.

For numbers of a and b that are relatively prime, and are of the form x^2+a*x+b, their set of primes increases 
significantly faster than when a and b are either both composit or not relatively prime. The rate of increase of 
the size of the set of primes for a and b relatively prime is great enough to say that there are infinitely many 
primes generated in this set.


A trivial conjecture that I observed:

For x^2+a*x+b for a equal to a multiple of 5 and b equal to a multiple of 10, a not equal to b. The set of primes
generated by this function is the empty set.


Problem #2.

For all of the x's that are prime to x(mod15) for x = (1,2,...,10^7),
they are also relatively prime to 15. They seem to appear approximately 
equal number of times with the exception of x = 2.

For n greater than 0 and and integer and for x = (1,2,...,10^7)
the x's prime to x%n are also relatively prime to n itself.
